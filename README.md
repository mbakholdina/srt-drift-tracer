# srt-drift-tracer

This project is created to study the clock drift between two peers and the models for its prediction.

Data traces for the analysis should be collected with the help of [drift-tracer utility](https://github.com/maxsharabayko/drift-tracer), a network utility for tracing clock drift between two peers.

`app.py` is an application written in [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/).
